# Longest Palindromic Subsequence
#
# [Medium] [AC:53.9% 132.1K of 245.3K] [filetype:python3]
#
# Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.
# You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
#
# "bbbab"
#
# Output:
#
# 4
#
# One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
#
# "cbbd"
#
# Output:
#
# 2
#
# One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
#
# s consists only of lowercase English letters.
