# Pascal's Triangle II

# [Easy] [AC:48.4% 278.9K of 576.1K] [filetype:python3]
#
# Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row
# of the Pascal's triangle.
#
# Note that the row index starts from 0.
#
# In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers
# directly above it.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: 3
#
# Output: [1,3,3,1]
#
# Follow up:
#
# Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
