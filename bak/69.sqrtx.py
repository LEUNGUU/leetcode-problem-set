# Sqrt(x)

# [Easy] [AC:33.6% 544.8K of 1.6M] [filetype:python3]
#
# Implement int sqrt(int x).
#
# Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be
# a non-negative integer.
#
# Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and
# only the integer part of the result is returned.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: 4
#
# Output: 2
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: 8
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since
#
#              the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
